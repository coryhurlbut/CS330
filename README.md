How do I approach designing software?
-I like to use wireframes to model the requirements. I like to wireframe some of the visuals as well as some of the component structure.
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  -I have never thought about how unity and such software handle certain things like wrapping texture and lighting. I will be more aware of this if i use it in the future. This will help me to understand what I need to do to achieve the desired result in terms of shading and scene lighting.
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  -I followed the tutorials and the DRY acronym to reuse the tutorial code or my previous code to just add on the new features each week. This cut down on prouction time greatly and kept me from struggling with setup wach time.
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  -I think this type of DRY iteration could be a good example to follow in the future in  many capacities. I think I did a better job at focusing on one aspect of the code at a time than I normally do.

How do I approach developing programs?
-I try to start at the root or core of the program and add in features as I go. I struggled getting some of the code refactored for ease of programming but I utilized some code I got online to make it much simpler.
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  -I do not really have a speciic way of programming so it is hard to say what I did different but it was new to do so much in C++. I think going milestone by milestone helped in learning each feature and its related functions/parts.
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  -The iteration from the milestones was great at focusing me and teachin gme each new skill/capability of OpenGL. 
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  -I went about each week differently as some weeks I tried to modify previous files and some I tried starting from scratch. After I started from scrttch once I felt a lot more confident in the code and slowly modified my program each week after. THis helped greatly in understanding and completing the milestones and homework.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-I believe computer science is an almost necessary thing to understand as more and more of our world is migrating to a digital counterpart. My goal of having a rich life in the sense i have freedom and time for myself and my family is something that is almost dependent on if I can make use of all of this technology instead of fall behind it.
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  -This class opened my eyes to how graphics are generated in code and I hope it is something I will be able to make great use of in the future. In education, I may use it for other courses.
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  -I may use this class in my current job as we have a team that creates unity based training software.
